Shark Alerts is an application for Android and iOS that notifies of the tagged sharks within a radius that is defined by each user. This warns users of potential danger and helps both the sharks and users to stay safe.

In addition, Shark Alerts displays a list of all tagged sharks near your location, along with details about each one including its species, weight, length, age, and gender. The Map view displays all tagged sharks in the world and also provides a detailed list of attributes for each shark. Within the app's settings, you can change your location, sensitivity radius, and frequency that the app checks for sharks.

Unfortunately, Shark Alerts was not able to be officially released on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store due to the shark tracking information not being public data.
