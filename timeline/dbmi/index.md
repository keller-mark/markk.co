During the summer of 2019, I participated in the [Summer Institute in Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/summer-institute-biomedical-informatics) at Harvard Medical School, working with the [Gehlenborg Lab](http://gehlenborglab.org/) on the development of [Vitessce](http://vitessce.io), a web-based visualization tool for spatial single-cell experiment data.
