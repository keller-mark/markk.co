During the summer of 2017, I interned with Chatham Financial, a company specializing in derivatives advisory and technology solutions that help organizations manage their debt and financial risk. 

I worked with a team to design and develop a web application (Angular 2, Typescript; Django, Python) that enabled annotation of loan documents to form a database of training examples. We subsequently used named entity recognition and our training set to automatically extract fields from unobserved documents.
