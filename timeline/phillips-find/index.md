During the fall 2017 semester, I continued to work with the [UMD FIRE program](https://fire.umd.edu/), as a member of the [Phillips Virtual Culture](https://fire.umd.edu/streams-PVC.html) research stream. I researched indoor location tracking and how it can be implemented in the museum environment. I developed an Android app called Phillips FIND, that uses [RSSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication) and existing wifi infrastructure to locate a user and provide information about nearby exhibits. In addition, data obtained through this app could be used by curators to analyze trends in visitor routes and paths through the museum.
