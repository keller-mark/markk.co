In the fall of 2018 I took CMSC320: Introduction to Data Science. Our final project involved the creation of a Jupyter Notebook detailing the data lifecycle: the iterative and linked processes of data collection, data processing, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing & machine learning, and insight & policy decision. Students have been instructed to post a static version of this notebook to GitHub pages; mine is available at [https://keller-mark.github.io/cmsc320-final-project/](https://keller-mark.github.io/cmsc320-final-project/).
