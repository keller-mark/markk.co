For the past year, I have been working with the [Leiserson Research Group](https://lrgr.io) advised by Professor Max Leiserson to develop a web-based tool called [ExploSig](https://explosig.lrgr.io) to enable exploration and interactive visualization of mutation signatures in human cancer and their etiology. ExploSig was presented as a late-breaking poster at [RECOMB 2019](https://recombccb.recomb2019.org/abstracts/) and won best poster at [BioVis@ISMB 2019](http://biovis.net/2019/index.html).
